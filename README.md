What these directories mean? you can view a codeforces' contest dashboard by entering the url: https://codeforces.com/contest/{contest_id}, where the contest_id is the name of the directory. It's probaly not a great idea to organize such a thing this way, but thats easy to get from the solution back to the problem. Anyway, i dont find it that much useful to store my solutions for all the contests i participate, but it's cool to keep them.
